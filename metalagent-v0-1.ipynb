Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you define. These changes can be the result of invoking an LLM, by calling an API, or executing any logic that the node defines.\n","\n","Each **edge** in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a text-only chatbot where output is always displayed to a user, you may always transition from `chatbot -> user`. The transitions can also be conditional, allowing you to add branching (like an `if-else` statement) or looping (like `for` or `while` loops).\n","\n","LangGraph is highly extensible and provides a number of features that are not part of this tutorial, such as memory, persistance and streaming.

The `get_menu` tool is wrapped in a [`ToolNode`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#toolnode) that handles calling the tool and passing the response as a message through the graph. The tools are also bound to the `llm` object so that the underlying model knows they exist. As you now have a different `llm` object to invoke, you need to update the `chatbot` node so that it is aware of the tools."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"be3f6e38","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.407157Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.406742Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.647936Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.646839Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.252855,"end_time":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.65068","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-11-15T16:20:28.397825","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n","\n","\n","# Define the tools and create a \"tools\" node.\n","tools = [get_menu]\n","tool_node = ToolNode(tools)\n","\n","# Attach the tools to the model so that it knows what it can call.\n","llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n","\n","\n","def maybe_route_to_tools(state: RequestState) -> Literal[\"tools\", \"human\"]:\n","    \"\"\"Route between human or tool nodes, depending if a tool call is made.\"\"\"\n","    if not (msgs := state.get(\"messages\", [])):\n","        raise ValueError(f\"No messages found when parsing state: {state}\")\n","\n","    # Only route based on the last message.\n","    msg = msgs[-1]\n","\n","    # When the chatbot returns tool_calls, route to the \"tools\" node.\n","    if hasattr(msg, \"tool_calls\") and len(msg.tool_calls) > 0:\n","        return \"tools\"\n","    else:\n","        return \"human\"\n","\n","\n","def chatbot_with_tools(state: RequestState) -> RequestState:\n","    \"\"\"The chatbot with tools.
